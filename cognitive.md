I think it's important to design for cognitive disabilities because more people
have them than all physical disabilities combined. I thought there might be more
complex rules for designing for those disabilities but really it's similar to
designing for any other audience. 

The main principal seems to be make it readable and keep it simple. Don't do 
things like put text in images when avoidable. Make the differentiations between
links, tabs, buttons, icons as obvious as possible. Also to make sure there is 
an alternative to images besides 'alt-text'. 

While these are important just to make websites accessible, there is also actual
health risks at stake. For instance, always avoid strobe effects as to make sure
my website isn't the cause for a life-threatening seizure. 

In terms of how these rules will help guide me when making my website, I think 
the spacing of sections and use of white space to focus reading content and also
making the content able to grow without ruining the layout are the important facets 
to focus on when creating a content-based site.
